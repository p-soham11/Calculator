# Calculator
### Making a basic calculator using PHP

I have used : Switch Statements, Loops, Functions and If-else Statements. 

**To start the PHP server,  Use use following command**
`php -S localhost:4000`

Now your Server has started on PORT 4000
Visit http://localhost:4000/calculate.php


*I will add some more functionality and update the calculator with CSS for better UI.*
